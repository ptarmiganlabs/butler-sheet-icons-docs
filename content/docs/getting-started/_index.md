# Getting Started

This section helps you get started with Butler Sheet Icons.

## Prerequisites

Butler Sheet Icons does not require installation. It is a standalone, cross-platform executable that you download and run.

However, you will need:

- Access to a Qlik Sense Cloud tenant or Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows server
- Appropriate permissions to create and modify sheet icons
- For QSEoW: Exported certificates from the QMC
- For QS Cloud: An API key

## Quick Start

Are you the impatient kind and just want to try it out?
No worries, here's what you need for Qlik Sense Cloud:

1. [Download](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-sheet-icons/releases/latest) the binary you need (Windows, macOS, Docker).
2. [Create an API key](https://qlik.dev/authenticate/api-key/generate-your-first-api-key) for Qlik Sense Cloud.
3. Make sure you know your Qlik Sense Cloud tenant URL, user ID, password, and ID of the app to update.
4. Run Butler Sheet Icons with the appropriate options.
